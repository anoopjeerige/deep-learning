# Basics of artificial neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning
This repository contains notebooks and python modules implemented in Tensorflow that explore:
 - Basics of Artificial Neural Networks
 - Deep Learning
 - Reinforcement Learning (Policy Gradient and Q-Learning)
 
 The Deep Learning concepts have been mainly taken from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.
 The Reinforcement Learning alogrithms have been mainly taken from reinforcement-learning repo by Denny Britz.
